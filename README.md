# ChatGPT-LCD-Chatbot
This project integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT with an Arduino-based LCD display using Python and Gradio. The chatbot receives user input, generates a response using ChatGPT, and displays the response on a 16x2 LCD screen connected to an Arduino.

FEATURES

Chat with ChatGPT via a web-based interface (Gradio)

Display responses on a 16x2 LCD screen

Communicate between Python and Arduino via Serial Communication

COMPONENTS REQUIRED

Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

16x2 LCD Display

10K Potentiometer (for LCD contrast control)

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

HOW IT WORKS

User inputs a message on the Gradio web interface.

ChatGPT generates a response using OpenAI's API.

Python sends the response via serial communication to Arduino.

Arduino receives the message and displays it on the 16x2 LCD screen.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Add support for scrolling text if the response is longer than 32 characters.

Implement button-based interaction to navigate responses.

Optimize serial communication for better efficiency.
